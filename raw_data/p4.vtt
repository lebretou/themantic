1
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.540
Zhongzheng Xu: Alright, okay, we can go ahead and get started. So…

2
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:17.840
Zhongzheng Xu: I'm going to start with, like, a pretty abstract question. So, when you hear the term, multi-agent system, what does it mean to you?

3
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.339
Quan Nguyen: So, a mediation system is, like, a system of, like, multiple agents, and each agent will work on a specific task.

4
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.040
Quan Nguyen: Yeah. So, and they need to, like, collaborate and interact with each other.

5
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.549
Quan Nguyen: So that's what I would define.

6
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:43.960
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, and then, could you tell me about, like, one or two representative projects that you've worked on that have used a multi-agent system?

7
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.150
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, yeah, so the last summer, I interned and I worked on, like, like a blending agent. So…

8
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.280
Quan Nguyen: It's, like, yeah, so that's, like, a s…

9
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.390
Quan Nguyen: quite a simpler version of documentations, because, the main…

10
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.350
Quan Nguyen: the main agent, like, the whole system. The task is to…

11
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:21.800
Quan Nguyen: like, allow user to, like, like, user having a plan, like, what they want to do, right? And the whole system has two great plans, like, supporting, like, providing step-by-step plans for the user, and then helping the user to track

12
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.919
Quan Nguyen: the plan… the plan, like, what is the progress they have made so far?

13
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.560
Quan Nguyen: Saw it in… include, like, the…

14
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.720
Quan Nguyen: The main agent, which is, like.

15
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.910
Quan Nguyen: like, we'll work with, Yusu, and…

16
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.199
Quan Nguyen: Like, return the response to the user, and another one… another agent is, like, the planning agent.

17
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.210
Zhongzheng Xu: So it's…

18
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.170
Quan Nguyen: Just for planning specifically. And also keep track of the progress, like.

19
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.600
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, because I defined, like, a schema. Like, what is the pro… like, what is the step ID?

20
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.970
Quan Nguyen: what does that step doing, and is the user done that? Like, what is the progress? Like, have they done it, or not yet?

21
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.669
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, so that… Planning agents just work on that specifically.

22
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.720
Quan Nguyen: And, like, yeah, and then there's a main agent, which is there. Like.

23
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.209
Quan Nguyen: walking with, like, call up. Hmm.

24
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:27.749
Quan Nguyen: So, like, getting information from the planning agent, and then return to the user, and, like, receiving command from the user, and interact with the planning agent to update the progress.

25
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:38.230
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, so, just for clarification, like, the users are the ones that actually execute the tasks, right?

26
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.710
Quan Nguyen: Yes, exactly. So, like, they done this task, and they just let the agent know that.

27
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.979
Quan Nguyen: like, they've done this step, but theirs can be… they can also come in, like, to update

28
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.299
Quan Nguyen: The step to be this or that.

29
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.619
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, I see. And then… so there's…

30
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.170
Zhongzheng Xu: Two agents, one that's talking to the user, and then another planning agent that's overseeing the entire progress.

31
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.390
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, and then,

32
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.449
Zhongzheng Xu: So, like, for this project, did you use any framework, like, like LaneChain, Lane Graph.

33
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.019
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I use both and also Landsmith's 2D book.

34
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.000
Zhongzheng Xu: Lane Smith's suitable debug.

35
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.220
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, because I use that for tracing in people.

36
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.760
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah.

37
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:36.640
Zhongzheng Xu: Interesting. You're actually the first interviewee that mentioned, Langsmith. Like, what was your experience using Langsmith?

38
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.080
Quan Nguyen: I think that's sold for my experience, I just used, like, the simplest I was part of that.

39
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:55.620
Quan Nguyen: just like that tracing, because I think it's pretty nice, because it helped me, like, debug much easier, and I don't have to, like, add a print statement everywhere else in the code.

40
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.700
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

41
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.509
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, and it also helped me track the, tool calling.

42
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.979
Quan Nguyen: And, like, what do they get from the tools? And, like, managing the…

43
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.460
Quan Nguyen: The memory of the agent as well.

44
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.050
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay. So… We'll actually talk about

45
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.050
Zhongzheng Xu: Managing tools and memory in a bit.

46
00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:25.910
Zhongzheng Xu: And then, but before that, I have a couple more, high-level questions. So,

47
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:34.010
Zhongzheng Xu: So, for the system that I just described, like, what kind of tasks have you, like, have a user done?

48
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.020
Quan Nguyen: So, it's mostly for Adobe, because the engine is Adobe, so it's, like, for Adobe products.

49
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.360
Zhongzheng Xu: So…

50
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.729
Quan Nguyen: Actually, my internship is just, like.

51
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.599
Quan Nguyen: more like a prototype version. It's not yet deployed in the process.

52
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.140
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

53
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:59.520
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, but, like, the main purpose will be, like, yeah, helping the user to do some tasks with other people just, like, maybe register for premium, subscription.

54
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.829
Quan Nguyen: Or, like, canceling the subscription, yeah, like that.

55
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.880
Zhongzheng Xu: Oh, I see, I see.

56
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:13.639
Zhongzheng Xu: And then, like… Did you, did you think that a multi-agent system, like.

57
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:22.770
Zhongzheng Xu: Or having that kind of structure is going to be helpful, versus maybe just having, like, a single LLM.

58
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:33.079
Quan Nguyen: So, from my experience and, like, from different documents I read, I believe, like, this thing, yeah, multiple agents will be better.

59
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.950
Quan Nguyen: I don't know, it's kind of like a trade-off.

60
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.810
Quan Nguyen: So, the agent, like, especially if you use, like, small language models, it can just, like, specialize in that task only, so it will be…

61
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.820
Quan Nguyen: Randa?

62
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.929
Quan Nguyen: like, provide better solution or, like, better accuracy than, like, a huge LM.

63
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.590
Quan Nguyen: Also.

64
00:05:51.700 --> 00:06:00.990
Quan Nguyen: But, like, the trade-off is there can be some errors, right? The agent, like, is not always correct, so they… the errors can be aggregated every time, like.

65
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.889
Quan Nguyen: Tool calling and stuff.

66
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.710
Quan Nguyen: So, that's a risk with that. Also…

67
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:14.590
Quan Nguyen: From my experience so far, like, working with agents, like, because they have to communicate with each other, it takes quite a lot of time.

68
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.930
Quan Nguyen: It's a process.

69
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.010
Zhongzheng Xu: I said.

70
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.799
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, so the latency is pretty high. And…

71
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.939
Quan Nguyen: Another part is, using agent-to-agent. I haven't tested that, really much.

72
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.269
Quan Nguyen: But, like, I would be working on, like, a huge agent system, and they…

73
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.590
Quan Nguyen: I heard from my mentor, she said that, like, there, I can…

74
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.460
Quan Nguyen: System also has troubling with communication between agents.

75
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.510
Quan Nguyen: Because, yeah, like, complication… Through agent-to-agent is simply, like, marked down and…

76
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.909
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, there can be errors as well.

77
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:55.229
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, do you know, like, usually what type of errors would occur?

78
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.059
Quan Nguyen: So, photos…

79
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:08.250
Quan Nguyen: your system, I don't know, because I don't work on that. But for my project, it can be, like, maybe the prompt is not clear enough.

80
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:16.029
Quan Nguyen: Or, like, there can be edge cases that the problem doesn't cover, so the agent will just decide something else that

81
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.989
Quan Nguyen: like, routing to something else, I don't ex…

82
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.730
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

83
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.020
Quan Nguyen: to me? Yeah.

84
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.539
Zhongzheng Xu: So, actually, it's…

85
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.739
Quan Nguyen: I think it's very challenging and difficult to control the behavior of the agents.

86
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.100
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

87
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.279
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, so,

88
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:55.120
Zhongzheng Xu: So for the same project, could you walk me through from, like, how you design the entire structure, including how did you design system prompts, how did you manage the tools, the memory, like, what contexts are shared between the agents, stuff like that.

89
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.539
Quan Nguyen: Hold on, I need to pull that report up.

90
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.740
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

91
00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:37.690
Quan Nguyen: So, it's simply, like, I will think about, like, similar to if-else. Let me share the screen.

92
00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.309
Zhongzheng Xu: Oh, yeah.

93
00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:40.299
Quan Nguyen: Can you allow me to do that?

94
00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.009
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah.

95
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.629
Quan Nguyen: Alright, so it's.

96
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.930
Zhongzheng Xu: Can you see that, GitHub one? Yes. Yeah, yeah.

97
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.710
Quan Nguyen: So, it's more like… like this.

98
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:08.580
Quan Nguyen: Like, so for the user prompts, we need to routing, like, whether to use the blender or not, because.

99
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:08.960
Zhongzheng Xu: That's competitive.

100
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.710
Quan Nguyen: Depending on the promise, can be, like, just simple questions, like.

101
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.560
Quan Nguyen: Maybe hi and hello from user.

102
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.160
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah.

103
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.599
Quan Nguyen: So, for that case, we don't need to use the planner, right? So, we just use some agents and…

104
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.399
Quan Nguyen: Provide a final response.

105
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.320
Zhongzheng Xu: And otherwise, if user asks, like.

106
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.269
Quan Nguyen: Help provide me steps to do this task.

107
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.540
Zhongzheng Xu: And then…

108
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.040
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, we need an agent to…

109
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:41.240
Quan Nguyen: all on multiple parts of us. So this is, yeah, like, a pretty simple version of mine, like, the…

110
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:50.300
Quan Nguyen: Because in the future, like, later than this, I will work on, like, separating them, like, the planning agencies separately.

111
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.650
Quan Nguyen: Yeah.

112
00:09:54.150 --> 00:10:00.360
Quan Nguyen: But, yeah, so… Likely, hold on.

113
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.459
Quan Nguyen: The process of, like, designing, right?

114
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.150
Zhongzheng Xu: Yo.

115
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:12.050
Quan Nguyen: So, yeah, at first I decided, like, whether to use the blending agent or not, so that's why I got lost to…

116
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:21.460
Quan Nguyen: arrows here, two directions here. And then, yeah, like, not using… when done using agents, pretty simple. But when using the planning.

117
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:28.110
Quan Nguyen: I have to provide… thinking of, like, what are the tools or things…

118
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.630
Quan Nguyen: tools, like, I need to go right to the agent, right?

119
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:32.680
Zhongzheng Xu: Right.

120
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:40.199
Quan Nguyen: And so, yeah, and then that's why I have to think about, like, what are the features that we need to allow the user to…

121
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.069
Quan Nguyen: to… do with their plan. Like, they have need… they can…

122
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.169
Quan Nguyen: They should be allowed to remove the one step of the plane.

123
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.539
Quan Nguyen: Or they want to change, update the step?

124
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.670
Quan Nguyen: Or, like, adding a new step, like, providing more detailed step.

125
00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.060
Quan Nguyen: It's a deadline?

126
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:05.000
Quan Nguyen: So that's why… Yeah, it has modules… actually, it's novel, like, it's more like a tool.

127
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.579
Quan Nguyen: It turned into a toast.

128
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.340
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, so that's… how I got to this one.

129
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.929
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, I think…

130
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:30.929
Zhongzheng Xu: I see. And then, did you, how did you, like, design, or what was the process of, like, designing, system prompts, and then,

131
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.580
Zhongzheng Xu: like you said, like, providing tools to the agents, was it…

132
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:42.559
Zhongzheng Xu: Was it easy, or did you have to, sort of, trial and… trial and error?

133
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:58.489
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, plus try and, because, advertise, just think of some test case, and then I try with that, and when it doesn't behave as I expect, I, like, just note down that white hair like that, and then I, yeah, just turn to Jatuity to

134
00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.549
Quan Nguyen: Help me fine-tune the prompt. Updating the prompt.

135
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.490
Quan Nguyen: Profitly.

136
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.449
Zhongzheng Xu: I see. I see.

137
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.010
Zhongzheng Xu: And, okay.

138
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:18.230
Zhongzheng Xu: I guess you already talked about most of the challenges, but just… Think… Thinking back,

139
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:26.690
Zhongzheng Xu: of this entire architecture design, was there any, like… what was, like, the most challenging part for you?

140
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:33.060
Quan Nguyen: For me, the most challenging part is, like, well…

141
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.570
Quan Nguyen: Where the user to, like, a plan, like, working with the staff in the plan, right?

142
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:48.139
Quan Nguyen: Because, currently I'm just setting to use the like, the step ID?

143
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:54.330
Quan Nguyen: So, it means that the user have to specify the step ID when

144
00:12:54.670 --> 00:13:04.850
Quan Nguyen: like, which step they want to update or make a change. But, like, I wanted to improve to, like, yeah, just from… I want to… this step, like, this step working on

145
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.000
Quan Nguyen: creating… Like, register for a new user.

146
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.660
Quan Nguyen: For example, it,

147
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:22.649
Quan Nguyen: I wanted to, like, the agent should be allowed… should be able to determine which step is that by their own, but not, like, explicit… experience…

148
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.090
Quan Nguyen: Explicitly saying the step.

149
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.109
Quan Nguyen: So that was the challenge that I haven't solved yet.

150
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.370
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, I see. So they have to, like, kind of manually…

151
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.010
Zhongzheng Xu: Log their progress.

152
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.850
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

153
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:49.870
Zhongzheng Xu: Alright, and then, you said that you used, Lanesmith for, like, monitoring the system.

154
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:57.889
Zhongzheng Xu: Like, what components of Landsmith, do you think was the most helpful?

155
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.830
Zhongzheng Xu: Lifetime.

156
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.830
Quan Nguyen: The one on the night space is… More like a…

157
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.910
Zhongzheng Xu: Like, what makes you think that the tool is helpful? Like, was it the log traces?

158
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:16.150
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, the lock tracing, so, like, when I have a prompt done from the user, I know which

159
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:21.140
Quan Nguyen: What is the input for each node, and what is the output?

160
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:26.840
Quan Nguyen: And then I can also trace, like, which step, like, which direction it will go next.

161
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.429
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, and because I'm also using the memory.

162
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.320
Quan Nguyen: Like, because the conversation will continue, like, between the agent and the user.

163
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.060
Zhongzheng Xu: Thank you.

164
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.739
Quan Nguyen: But Joe, what… I'll fit it into the memory.

165
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.360
Zhongzheng Xu: I see. And then,

166
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.219
Zhongzheng Xu: Like, when you're still, let's say, implementing the system, when you're still coding.

167
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:58.189
Zhongzheng Xu: Did you run into any bugs? Like… Can you recall, like,

168
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.149
Zhongzheng Xu: Pretty difficult book that you had.

169
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.610
Zhongzheng Xu: No, it's okay.

170
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.019
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, I don't remember much better.

171
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.300
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

172
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.440
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

173
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:21.770
Zhongzheng Xu: And then… So, you set…

174
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:28.219
Zhongzheng Xu: I think you mentioned it, but, like, so were you able to actually, test the systems with,

175
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.640
Zhongzheng Xu: Some real users, or were you just mostly testing yourself?

176
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.929
Quan Nguyen: I'm mostly testing myself, yeah, because…

177
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.180
Quan Nguyen: I know it's not yet deployed.

178
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.830
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay. And… Since you're testing yourself, like…

179
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.379
Zhongzheng Xu: When did you, so, what made you feel, like, confident?

180
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.279
Zhongzheng Xu: That this system is pretty reliable and consistent.

181
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.719
Quan Nguyen: No, actually, I don't think so.

182
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.660
Zhongzheng Xu: Oh, you don't think so?

183
00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.130
Quan Nguyen: Yeah.

184
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.890
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, I think this one, we need a lot more improvement.

185
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.490
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

186
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.339
Quan Nguyen: Well, what makes you… what makes you think that way?

187
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.170
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, like, from all those flaws that I told you for, like.

188
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:18.249
Quan Nguyen: It's quite difficult to control which direction it will go to, especially whether you use the blending or not.

189
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:23.189
Quan Nguyen: like, at first, for example, for some tasks, I…

190
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.700
Quan Nguyen: have to explicitly say that I want to plan this.

191
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.700
Quan Nguyen: So that it will just… it will trigger the planning agent.

192
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.119
Zhongzheng Xu: Otherwise…

193
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:41.030
Quan Nguyen: So, for some time, I just, like, do this, and it's just, like, the agent recharge, like…

194
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:48.699
Quan Nguyen: for some… because for some test case, I asked it to from, like, To do something.

195
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.850
Quan Nguyen: the middle step as well, but, like, the Lee, not intriguing it.

196
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.340
Quan Nguyen: It just felt like it doesn't need the planning.

197
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.510
Zhongzheng Xu: Oh, I see. So, like, triggering the planning agent.

198
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.180
Quan Nguyen: Yeah.

199
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.619
Zhongzheng Xu: Interesting.

200
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.709
Zhongzheng Xu: Do you think it was, like, a prompt issue, or…

201
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.959
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, that can be the prompt issue, so that's why, I mean, I try to update the prompt.

202
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:22.459
Quan Nguyen: But, like, I'm not confident that it will be able to cover all the edge cases, especially in the production.

203
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.710
Zhongzheng Xu: When…

204
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.779
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, there are many different scenarios with the users.

205
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.419
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, I just haven't… Tied up that.

206
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.440
Quan Nguyen: Watch.

207
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.210
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

208
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:39.709
Zhongzheng Xu: And then… Do you think this is…

209
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:51.569
Zhongzheng Xu: I don't know if you have done it, but, like, if you just use the same exact prompt, same input, do you think it's sometimes relative to the planning agent, sometimes it doesn't?

210
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.040
Quan Nguyen: Hmm.

211
00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:03.650
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, I… I don't remember when, like, yeah, but for some… I remember for some days.

212
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.969
Quan Nguyen: It can be like that.

213
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:06.960
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

214
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.020
Quan Nguyen: Yes, so that's what I meant. It's not… really stable.

215
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.569
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay. I see. I see.

216
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:22.470
Zhongzheng Xu: So I know this is a past project, and you haven't… and you probably haven't looked at it for a while, but…

217
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:38.370
Zhongzheng Xu: if you have, like, so, let's say Lanesmith, or just Langchain, LaneGraph in general, if there's some new feature that you can add to it that would help you with the process of developing, what do you think

218
00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.779
Zhongzheng Xu: They can be.

219
00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:46.990
Quan Nguyen: That's interesting.

220
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.140
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, I don't know.

221
00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:01.359
Quan Nguyen: I don't have any ideas now, because last time when I used Langraph, I pretty… I believe this.

222
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.740
Quan Nguyen: like, cover pretty… We have, like, different functions already.

223
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:15.560
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah, it's pretty good. What about, okay, maybe not Lance… Lane Chain, what about, like, Lanesmith?

224
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:18.160
Quan Nguyen: Yes, ma'am?

225
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:24.859
Quan Nguyen: Last minute, I… yeah, the issue is I don't use this much. Okay. Like, I just use simply for…

226
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.270
Zhongzheng Xu: We're deep.

227
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.490
Quan Nguyen: Administration, yeah.

228
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.809
Quan Nguyen: So, and I think, like, the tracing works pretty well.

229
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.639
Quan Nguyen: It shows me all the, like, the…

230
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.549
Quan Nguyen: It takes, and the input and output.

231
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:42.110
Quan Nguyen: So I can trace, like, For each end node here, each tool calling.

232
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.350
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

233
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.020
Zhongzheng Xu: Oh yeah, so… I'm actually…

234
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:08.190
Zhongzheng Xu: I haven't used Langsmith myself, but I know it… it does… it does show you, like, input and output.

235
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:14.459
Zhongzheng Xu: Does it also help you with, like, managing, memory and context?

236
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.059
Quan Nguyen: The context part is for the length graph.

237
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.900
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, complex.

238
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.989
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, Linecraft does support, like, memory tracking.

239
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.669
Quan Nguyen: This, like, yeah, allow me to add memory to the agent.

240
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:37.270
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, I see. But does Landsmith also help you, like, visual, like, visualize that?

241
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.380
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, it's all when tracing, it also shows the memory.

242
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.070
Zhongzheng Xu: I see. So I can check that as well.

243
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.070
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

244
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.400
Zhongzheng Xu: And then, you said that… you,

245
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.629
Zhongzheng Xu: Even, like, even now, you don't really…

246
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.859
Zhongzheng Xu: think the system is reliable. Like…

247
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:15.519
Zhongzheng Xu: When do you… like, what signals or indicators Do you think…

248
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:24.699
Zhongzheng Xu: If you, like, if you see them, you would think, this system is pretty reliable and consistent, and you can trust having users actually use it.

249
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.890
Quan Nguyen: Hmm.

250
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.750
Quan Nguyen: It's pretty tough.

251
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:35.720
Quan Nguyen: Actually, Because of that, I really hate working with AI agents in general.

252
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:37.370
Quan Nguyen: Yeah.

253
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.999
Quan Nguyen: What is the signal that let me know that it's reliable?

254
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:57.570
Quan Nguyen: pretty challenging, yeah, because I haven't thought of that, because mostly it's… From the agent's output.

255
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.229
Quan Nguyen: like… Depending on the prompts and the…

256
00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:10.670
Quan Nguyen: The input of the users, the output of the language model maybe can be changed a bit.

257
00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:19.069
Zhongzheng Xu: I see. So, maybe, like… After we have run,

258
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.170
Zhongzheng Xu: Like, a dataset of different prompts, and then…

259
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:32.080
Zhongzheng Xu: And then the final output is… or, like, the traces are aligning with your expectation.

260
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.010
Quan Nguyen: Yeah.

261
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:34.599
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, I see.

262
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.170
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, so…

263
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.700
Quan Nguyen: Otherwise, I think just, focus on the prompt engineering part.

264
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:48.760
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, so you would say that, prompt engineering… prompt engineering was probably the most important.

265
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.960
Quan Nguyen: Yeah.

266
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.599
Quan Nguyen: Especially if I want the agent to…

267
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:59.000
Quan Nguyen: like, especially at each… at each node here, and if I want it to be…

268
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.709
Quan Nguyen: follow my expectation, I had to write very, very detailed.

269
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.649
Quan Nguyen: What a prompt.

270
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.989
Zhongzheng Xu: For the prompts?

271
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:14.790
Zhongzheng Xu: I see and then… Okay.

272
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.500
Zhongzheng Xu: Let me just try to locate the questions.

273
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:30.079
Zhongzheng Xu: okay, let's go back to, being more abstract, so maybe, maybe not just this project.

274
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.710
Zhongzheng Xu: So, like, for what types…

275
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:39.050
Zhongzheng Xu: What type of problems do you think a multi-agent system works the best?

276
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:47.950
Zhongzheng Xu: Or, like, for what kind of tasks that you think it's appropriate to, use a multi-agent system?

277
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.369
Quan Nguyen: So… What kind of task?

278
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.130
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah, like, what kind of problems?

279
00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:01.829
Zhongzheng Xu: Do you think… so if you're the product manager, and then you have some tasks.

280
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.979
Zhongzheng Xu: To have your software engineers do,

281
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:12.370
Zhongzheng Xu: Like, what type of tasks do you think you'll have them? Okay, you guys should use a multi-agent system?

282
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:21.129
Quan Nguyen: Then I would refer to Adobe's broader, like, agent system, because, I think they are…

283
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.680
Quan Nguyen: The code base is spreading well.

284
00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.480
Quan Nguyen: Like that very well.

285
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.919
Quan Nguyen: Actually, I can send you that, I… because…

286
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.740
Quan Nguyen: So there is one that I…

287
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.929
Quan Nguyen: locked into that, what are you?

288
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.239
Quan Nguyen: So, Adobe… Adobe is Agent Orchestrator, so I think it's

289
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.130
Quan Nguyen: They did very well for that.

290
00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:05.099
Quan Nguyen: Because… Yeah, because, rather than, like, using the whole, like, one agent to work on different tasks.

291
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:11.739
Quan Nguyen: They just use the agent to do some specific tasks, like, from prompt to SQL…

292
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.829
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, so I think that is much more reliable, especially if you fine-tune the

293
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:25.149
Quan Nguyen: the language model just for that task only. So I think it's much more reliable than just using a generic

294
00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.009
Quan Nguyen: Luggage model to do different tasks.

295
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.740
Zhongzheng Xu: I see. I don't… I'm not too familiar with this…

296
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:41.399
Zhongzheng Xu: So what does this do? The link that you just shared?

297
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.020
Quan Nguyen: Oh, yeah, so it's, like, a product from Adobe, it's called Adobe… agents called Orchestrator.

298
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.549
Quan Nguyen: like,

299
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:59.250
Quan Nguyen: I don't really remember a lot, but I remember there is… there are some agents that work on just exactly that specific problem.

300
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.980
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

301
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:07.240
Quan Nguyen: They have just one… the whole agent, just, I mean, one agent just for, like, converting from prompt.

302
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.980
Quan Nguyen: like, from text to SQL query.

303
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:11.780
Quan Nguyen: Yeah.

304
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.850
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

305
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:19.249
Zhongzheng Xu: So, so… They provide all of these specialized agents.

306
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.680
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

307
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:22.390
Zhongzheng Xu: Oh, I see.

308
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:28.699
Zhongzheng Xu: And then, does… I'm just looking at the screenshot here.

309
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:39.250
Zhongzheng Xu: So, you still, like, kind of input a… users just put in the prompt, and then… it does…

310
00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.439
Zhongzheng Xu: It does everything for you.

311
00:26:42.320 --> 00:27:00.959
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, so they have, like, an orchestrator, so it will decide it to route the user prompt to which agent to, like, execute the users from next. So, because there are multiple specialized agents, so, like, one is working with, databases, one is working with,

312
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.280
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, different parts of, like, LP system, the photo system.

313
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:14.390
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, so it, depending on the use of sprung, the orchestrator will routing To that agent.

314
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.470
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

315
00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:18.499
Quan Nguyen: So I think, yeah, no, it,

316
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:27.259
Quan Nguyen: So back to your question, like, what to make, what are the signals to make our system be more reliable? I think it's to break down

317
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:33.840
Quan Nguyen: The agents, the whole system, and to use, agent… specialized agents, rather than…

318
00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:41.459
Quan Nguyen: One agent should do multiple tasks, so, like, a general agent, a general language model for an agent.

319
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.110
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

320
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.060
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

321
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.080
Zhongzheng Xu: And then this,

322
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:57.600
Zhongzheng Xu: this tool also… so for, like, for a single task, it can be using multiple agents, right? Each for…

323
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.980
Zhongzheng Xu: Specialized, subtasks.

324
00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.930
Quan Nguyen: Wait, can you… can you repeat the question? So, for each prompt…

325
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:11.390
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah, so for, this tool that you just shared,

326
00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.249
Zhongzheng Xu: Let's say the user inputs some task.

327
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:24.350
Zhongzheng Xu: does the system use just a single agent, or it also… if the task is.

328
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.880
Quan Nguyen: Oh.

329
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.340
Zhongzheng Xu: Located.

330
00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.350
Quan Nguyen: That's a good question. I think I'm… Mitch this part.

331
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.460
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, okay.

332
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:40.930
Zhongzheng Xu: That's fine. And,

333
00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.910
Zhongzheng Xu: I just have a last question. I think we already talked about this,

334
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.830
Zhongzheng Xu: feel free to skip. So…

335
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:56.719
Zhongzheng Xu: Just going back to developing the entire system, when you're coding.

336
00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:57.490
Quan Nguyen: Hmm.

337
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.939
Zhongzheng Xu: What are some challenges, and what do you think can help with that?

338
00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:14.010
Quan Nguyen: So I think, yeah, back to the… that one, it's… one of the challenges is…

339
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:23.559
Quan Nguyen: Because it should be followed, like, a graph, right? Because it has direction from this agent, like, to this node, to another node, or, like, between agents.

340
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.580
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah. So…

341
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.559
Quan Nguyen: difficult part is I have to write everything on

342
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:34.339
Quan Nguyen: Like, a paper or on a note to keep track of, like, which

343
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.040
Quan Nguyen: Which node is interacting with each other?

344
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.600
Quan Nguyen: Like, which component is interacting with each other?

345
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:47.239
Quan Nguyen: And then I will implement based on that. Otherwise, it's very, very, like, confusing and…

346
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.250
Quan Nguyen: It just looked like a mess to me.

347
00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.149
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, yeah. That's interesting.

348
00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.900
Zhongzheng Xu: That's interesting. Okay.

349
00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:02.529
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, I can end the meeting, or end the recording.

350
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.940
Zhongzheng Xu: Actually, so… I…

351
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.590
Zhongzheng Xu: I want… I wanted to end because I wanted to talk about, like, what kind of…

352
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:28.509
Zhongzheng Xu: research that I think, we're doing, or, like, what kind of tools that we'll build, in the end, is because, you know how… because the reason why,

353
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.200
Zhongzheng Xu: I can share my screen real quick.

354
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:32.880
Quan Nguyen: Okay.

355
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:51.060
Zhongzheng Xu: So… You know how currently there's, these tools .

356
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.399
Quan Nguyen: Yeah, I know that one.

357
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:53.860
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah, yeah.

358
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.680
Quan Nguyen: local.

359
00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:05.070
Zhongzheng Xu: It's for low-code, like, building of your multi-agent system. There's all kinds of tools that look like this.

360
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.449
Zhongzheng Xu: Things like these.

361
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.509
Zhongzheng Xu: But then…

362
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:28.230
Zhongzheng Xu: So, we think that one problem of… with these tools is that even though they provide good visuals, like, they, they're showing very clearly of the entire structure of your system, and then they also show, like, inputs and outputs.

363
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.789
Zhongzheng Xu: Also, like, what kind of tools?

364
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.199
Zhongzheng Xu: That maybe our agent is using.

365
00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:46.569
Zhongzheng Xu: But I feel like they're just not as flexible as if you're just using Langchain or LaneGraph, because it's just Python, like, you can do whatever.

366
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.330
Quan Nguyen: Hmm.

367
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:54.530
Zhongzheng Xu: So we're thinking to maybe… Make… to maybe, build, like, an add-on to…

368
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.820
Zhongzheng Xu: to Lane Chain Lane Graph, so that you can actually

369
00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:04.140
Zhongzheng Xu: visualize in real time when we were still, like, developing the system.

370
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:15.439
Zhongzheng Xu: And that's kind of different from… from Lanesmith, because Lanesmith is more so when you have the system ready, or at least you have, like, a working prototype. Yeah.

371
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:21.300
Zhongzheng Xu: But before that, you can't really, like, visualize the system.

372
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:28.040
Quan Nguyen: Oh, that's cool. I… Hold on, I remember LineGraph has the similar, similar.

373
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.200
Quan Nguyen: But, like, it's… Difficult, somehow it's difficult to use.

374
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.549
Quan Nguyen: Because last time when I tried with my com- computer, it just doesn't work.

375
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.380
Quan Nguyen: I forget what is that called, like,

376
00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:50.679
Quan Nguyen: But, pretty sure it's available on LineGraph as well. Oh, it's called Linecraft Studio.

377
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.319
Zhongzheng Xu: Than graphs to do.

378
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.090
Quan Nguyen: So it's a lot to visualize one.

379
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.290
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah, I know.

380
00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:56.870
Quan Nguyen: Yeah.

381
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:59.430
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah.

382
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:08.360
Quan Nguyen: Oh, yeah, also another issue, like, I think can be, a problem with the multi-agents.

383
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:14.189
Quan Nguyen: an AI agent in general, for me, is because every time we call

384
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:20.230
Quan Nguyen: Like, an agent's working, right? It will, like, call in a request.

385
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.579
Quan Nguyen: Two, hosts, right?

386
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.380
Quan Nguyen: It can be, like, a bottleneck when we scale to production.

387
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.840
Zhongzheng Xu: Hmm, can you explain more?

388
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.940
Quan Nguyen: Mmm… So, I mean, firstly, it's when we…

389
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.089
Quan Nguyen: I have to, like, send requests to the model.

390
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.090
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah.

391
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:48.610
Quan Nguyen: from Avil, it may take some time and to get the response back, right?

392
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:49.200
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay.

393
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:53.720
Quan Nguyen: This snake cannot be processed in a batch?

394
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.470
Zhongzheng Xu: I see.

395
00:33:55.470 --> 00:34:03.060
Quan Nguyen: So, yeah, I think that's a bottleneck. So, if the system, like, multi-agent system is complicated.

396
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.720
Quan Nguyen: It may increase the latency as well.

397
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.660
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah.

398
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:13.409
Quan Nguyen: Even though I know, like, there should be some research working on paralleling… parallelizing the…

399
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.569
Quan Nguyen: components in the agent system, but I haven't logged into that yet.

400
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.840
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

401
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:26.189
Zhongzheng Xu: I think that's the reason why, like, a lot of these frameworks, they all have some…

402
00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:33.119
Zhongzheng Xu: sort of, fallback strategies, if you like… Oh, yeah, I thought of that.

403
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:40.979
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah, if you fail, let's say, 3 times in a row, then it just goes to a failure branch.

404
00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.409
Quan Nguyen: Hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

405
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.810
Zhongzheng Xu: Yeah.

406
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.409
Zhongzheng Xu: Okay, I think I can stop recording now.
